# Titanic-ML-Model

The Titanic Dataset is so infamous on Kaggle that it has essentially become a right of passage into the Data Science community. The goal of the project is simple: given features on each passenger that was aboard the Titanic, predict who lived and who died. I believe my approach to the Titanic competition separates my notebook from others because of my use of feature engineering, different approaches to dealing with missing values, and in-depth analysis of the machine learning algorithms that produced the best accuracies. 

It is generally accepted that a Titanic model with an accuracy above 70% on the public leaderboard is a very good model. I was able to score 81.34%, which was top 1.5% of the leaderboard as of the time of my submission. 

After exploring the Kaggle interface and getting familiar with the Data Science community, I've become excited about participating in the many competitions available on the platform. The Titanic dataset was a fantastic introduction, and I look forward to competing in more challenges in the future.
